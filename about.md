Fluidity Space Services was founded by [Tyler Schell](_team/tyler-schell.md) and [Noah Gula](_team/noah-gula.md) to address challenges faced by the aerospace and automotive industries. In particular, Tyler and Noah identified a lack of manufacturing readiness to support both state-of-the-art technology programs with little or no heritage, as well as immature support infrastructure for the demanding automotive manufacturing environment. In response, Tyler and Noah teamed up to support America's forefront industries and offer their expertise.

Fluidity supports its clients in all facets of product commercialization, from requirements definition and design qualification, to manufacturing process development. Specifically, Fluidity has expertise in advanced propulsion technologies, on-orbit servicing, assembly, and manufacturing, design for advanced manufacturing, and process development.
